		<h1>About RAM</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>
			RAM: Regularly Absent Memory is my entry for the 2020 Incremental Game Jam. The theme was
			shrinking, and as that is what my available RAM does all the time, that's what I chose to base
			the game around. The premise is to open more and more chrome tabs until you eventually run out
			of available RAM on your computer.
